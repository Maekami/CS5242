{"example_question": "Alice and Bob live on the same road. At time  $t$ , they both decide to walk to each other's houses at constant speed. However, they were busy thinking about math so that they didn't realize passing each other. Alice arrived at Bob's house at  $3:19\\text{pm}$ , and Bob arrived at Alice's house at  $3:29\\text{pm}$ . Charlie, who was driving by, noted that Alice and Bob passed each other at  $3:11\\text{pm}$ . Find the difference in minutes between the time Alice and Bob left their own houses and noon on that day.\n\n*Proposed by Kevin You*", "example_cot": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. So, Alice and Bob both start walking towards each other's houses at the same time t. They pass each other at 3:11 pm, which Charlie noticed. Then, Alice arrives at Bob's house at 3:19 pm, and Bob arrives at Alice's house at 3:29 pm. We need to find the difference in minutes between the time they left their houses (time t) and noon. So, essentially, we need to find how many minutes after noon they started walking.\n\nFirst, let's convert all the given times into minutes past noon to make calculations easier. Noon is 12:00 pm, so:\n\n- 3:11 pm is 3 hours and 11 minutes after noon. That's 3*60 + 11 = 180 + 11 = 191 minutes.\n- 3:19 pm is 3*60 + 19 = 180 + 19 = 199 minutes.\n- 3:29 pm is 3*60 + 29 = 180 + 29 = 209 minutes.\n\nSo, they passed each other at 191 minutes past noon, Alice arrived at Bob's house at 199 minutes, and Bob arrived at Alice's house at 209 minutes.\n\nLet’s denote the time they left their houses as t minutes past noon. So, the time they started walking is t, and they met at t + T = 191 minutes, where T is the time taken from departure until they met.\n\nBut wait, actually, t is the departure time. So, the time from departure until meeting each other is 191 - t minutes. Similarly, the time from meeting until Alice arrives at Bob's house is 199 - 191 = 8 minutes. Similarly, Bob takes 209 - 191 = 18 minutes to reach Alice's house after passing each other.\n\nSince they are walking at constant speeds, the ratio of their speeds should be the inverse of the ratio of the times they took after passing each other to reach the opposite houses. Because the distance each covers after passing is the distance the other had already covered before passing. Hmm, maybe I need to think about that more carefully.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Let v_A be Alice's speed.\n\n- Let v_B be Bob's speed.\n\n- Let d be the distance between their houses.\n\nWhen they start walking towards each other, the sum of their speeds is v_A + v_B, so the time until they meet is (d)/(v_A + v_B). However, in this problem, we know they met 191 - t minutes after starting, and then Alice took 8 more minutes to reach Bob's house, while Bob took 18 more minutes to reach Alice's house.\n\nAlternatively, after meeting, Alice has to cover the distance that Bob had already covered before the meeting, and vice versa. So, the distance Alice covers after meeting is equal to the distance Bob covered before meeting, and vice versa.\n\nLet’s formalize this. Let’s say that when they meet, Alice has walked a distance of v_A * (191 - t) minutes, and Bob has walked v_B * (191 - t) minutes. The total distance between the houses is d = v_A*(191 - t) + v_B*(191 - t) = (v_A + v_B)*(191 - t).\n\nAfter meeting, Alice needs to walk the remaining distance to Bob's house, which is the distance Bob had already walked before meeting, which is v_B*(191 - t). Alice's speed is v_A, so the time she takes to cover that distance is (v_B*(191 - t))/v_A = 8 minutes. Similarly, Bob needs to walk the remaining distance to Alice's house, which is v_A*(191 - t), so the time he takes is (v_A*(191 - t))/v_B = 18 minutes.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. (v_B*(191 - t))/v_A = 8\n2. (v_A*(191 - t))/v_B = 18\n\nLet’s denote x = 191 - t. Then the equations become:\n\n1. (v_B * x)/v_A = 8\n2. (v_A * x)/v_B = 18\n\nLet’s write the first equation as v_B / v_A = 8 / x, and the second as v_A / v_B = 18 / x.\n\nMultiplying these two equations: (v_B / v_A) * (v_A / v_B) = (8 / x) * (18 / x) => 1 = (144) / x² => x² = 144 => x = 12 (since x is time, positive)\n\nTherefore, x = 12 minutes. So, 191 - t = 12 => t = 191 - 12 = 179 minutes past noon.\n\nSo, the time they left their houses is 179 minutes after noon. Therefore, the difference between the time they left and noon is 179 minutes. So the answer is 179 minutes.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this.\n\nIf t is 179 minutes past noon, which is 2 hours and 59 minutes, so 2:59 pm. Then, they started walking at 2:59 pm, met at 3:11 pm (which is 12 minutes later), then Alice took 8 minutes to reach Bob's house, arriving at 3:19 pm, and Bob took 18 minutes to reach Alice's house, arriving at 3:29 pm. That seems to check out.\n\nBut let's confirm with speeds. Let’s suppose the distance between their houses is d. Then, before meeting, Alice walked for 12 minutes at speed v_A, covering distance 12v_A. Bob walked for 12 minutes at speed v_B, covering 12v_B. The total distance is 12(v_A + v_B) = d.\n\nAfter meeting, Alice has to cover Bob's previous distance, which is 12v_B, at her speed v_A, taking 12v_B / v_A = 8 minutes. Similarly, Bob has to cover 12v_A at his speed v_B, taking 12v_A / v_B = 18 minutes.\n\nFrom Alice's equation: 12v_B = 8v_A => 3v_B = 2v_A => v_A = (3/2)v_B\n\nFrom Bob's equation: 12v_A = 18v_B => 2v_A = 3v_B => same as above, so consistent.\n\nTherefore, the speeds are in a 3:2 ratio. So, if we take v_A = 3k and v_B = 2k for some k, then the total distance d = 12*(3k + 2k) = 12*5k = 60k. Then Alice's remaining distance after meeting is 12v_B = 24k, which she covers at 3k per minute, taking 24k / 3k = 8 minutes. Bob's remaining distance is 12v_A = 36k, which he covers at 2k per minute, taking 36k / 2k = 18 minutes. All checks out.\n\nTherefore, t = 179 minutes past noon, so the difference between the time they left and noon is 179 minutes. Therefore, the answer is 179. So, I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{179}", "current_question": "Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards.

The sides are given as AB = 5, BC = 7, and AC = 3. The angle bisector of angle A meets BC at D and then intersects the circle ω again at E. Then there's another circle γ with diameter DE. The circles ω and γ intersect again at a point F, and we need to find AF², which is equal to m/n where m and n are coprime positive integers, and then compute m + n.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the problem. Let me sketch the triangle ABC with the given side lengths. AB = 5, BC = 7, AC = 3. Wait, triangle with sides 3, 5, 7. Let me check if that's possible. The sum of the two smaller sides is 3 + 5 = 8, which is greater than 7, so yes, it is a valid triangle.\n\nNow, angle bisector from A meets BC at D. So by the Angle Bisector Theorem, BD/DC = AB/AC = 5/3. Since BC is 7, BD = (5/8)*7 = 35/8, and DC = 21/8. So BD = 35/8, DC = 21/8. That's straightforward.\n\nThen, the angle bisector goes on to meet the circumcircle ω again at E. So E is the other intersection point of the angle bisector with the circumcircle. Then, circle γ has DE as its diameter. The two circles ω and γ meet again at F, and we need AF².\n\nHmm. So perhaps we need to find coordinates for the points and compute AF²? Or maybe use power of a point, properties of angle bisectors, cyclic quadrilaterals, etc. Let me think.\n\nFirst, let's recall that in a triangle, the angle bisector length can be computed, but here we might need properties related to the circumcircle. Since E is on the circumcircle and on the angle bisector, maybe there are some known theorems or properties about such points.\n\nAlternatively, coordinate geometry might work. Let me try setting up coordinates. Let me place point B at (0,0), point C at (7,0). Then point A is somewhere such that AB = 5, AC = 3. Let me compute coordinates of A.\n\nLet’s denote coordinates of A as (x,y). Then distance from A to B is 5, so:\n\n√(x² + y²) = 5 => x² + y² = 25.\n\nDistance from A to C is 3, so:\n\n√((x - 7)² + y²) = 3 => (x - 7)² + y² = 9.\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\n\n(x - 7)² + y² - x² - y² = 9 - 25 => x² -14x +49 -x² = -16 => -14x +49 = -16 => -14x = -65 => x = 65/14 ≈ 4.64. Then y² = 25 - (65/14)². Let me compute that:\n\n65/14 squared: 65² = 4225, 14² = 196. So 4225/196. Then 25 is 4900/196. So y² = 4900/196 - 4225/196 = 675/196. Therefore, y = √(675)/14 = (15√3)/14. So coordinates of A are (65/14, (15√3)/14).\n\nOkay, that's a bit messy, but manageable. Now, point D is on BC with BD = 35/8 and DC = 21/8. Since BC is from (0,0) to (7,0), so the coordinates of D can be found by moving 35/8 from B towards C. So since BC is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (7,0), the x-coordinate of D is 35/8. Wait, but 35/8 is 4.375, which is less than 7, so yes. So coordinates of D are (35/8, 0).\n\nNow, angle bisector AE. Since A is (65/14, 15√3/14), and D is (35/8, 0), the line AD is the angle bisector. We need to find the other intersection point E of this line with the circumcircle ω. Since we already have the equation of ω (from points A, B, C), perhaps we can parametrize line AD and find its other intersection with ω.\n\nAlternatively, since we have coordinates for A, B, C, we can find the equation of the circumcircle ω. Let me try that.\n\nGiven three points: B(0,0), C(7,0), A(65/14, 15√3/14). Let's find the circumcircle equation.\n\nThe general equation of a circle is x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0. Plugging in B(0,0):\n\n0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + F = 0 => F = 0.\n\nSo equation becomes x² + y² + Dx + Ey = 0.\n\nNow plug in C(7,0):\n\n7² + 0 + 7D + 0 = 0 => 49 + 7D = 0 => D = -7.\n\nSo equation is x² + y² -7x + Ey = 0.\n\nNow plug in A(65/14, 15√3/14):\n\n(65/14)² + (15√3/14)² -7*(65/14) + E*(15√3/14) = 0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(65/14)² = (4225)/196\n\n(15√3/14)² = (225*3)/196 = 675/196\n\n-7*(65/14) = -455/14 = -65/2\n\nE*(15√3/14) remains.\n\nSo sum:\n\n4225/196 + 675/196 - 65/2 + (15√3/14)E = 0\n\nCompute 4225 + 675 = 4900, so 4900/196 = 25. So:\n\n25 - 65/2 + (15√3/14)E = 0\n\n25 is 50/2, so 50/2 - 65/2 = -15/2.\n\nThus:\n\n-15/2 + (15√3/14)E = 0 => (15√3/14)E = 15/2 => E = (15/2) / (15√3/14) = (15/2) * (14)/(15√3) = (14)/(2√3) = 7/√3 = 7√3/3.\n\nTherefore, the equation of the circumcircle ω is x² + y² -7x + (7√3/3)y = 0.\n\nNow, we need the parametric equation of line AD. Points A(65/14, 15√3/14) and D(35/8, 0). Let's find the parametric equations.\n\nFirst, compute the direction vector from A to D: (35/8 - 65/14, 0 - 15√3/14). Let me compute 35/8 - 65/14:\n\nConvert to common denominator 56: 35/8 = 245/56, 65/14 = 260/56. So 245/56 - 260/56 = -15/56. The y-component is -15√3/14.\n\nSo the direction vector is (-15/56, -15√3/14). Simplify by factoring out -15/14: (-15/56, -15√3/14) = -15/14*(1/4, √3). So direction vector is proportional to (1/4, √3). Maybe parametrize the line as:\n\nx = 65/14 + t*(1/4)\n\ny = 15√3/14 + t*√3\n\nWe can use this parametrization. Then we need to find the other intersection point E with the circumcircle ω. Since A is already on the line and the circle, the other intersection is E.\n\nSo substitute x and y into the circle equation:\n\nx² + y² -7x + (7√3/3)y = 0\n\nSubstitute:\n\n(65/14 + t/4)² + (15√3/14 + t√3)^2 -7*(65/14 + t/4) + (7√3/3)*(15√3/14 + t√3) = 0\n\nThis seems quite involved. Let's compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst, expand (65/14 + t/4)^2:\n\n= (65/14)^2 + 2*(65/14)*(t/4) + (t/4)^2\n\n= 4225/196 + (65/28)t + t²/16\n\nSimilarly, expand (15√3/14 + t√3)^2:\n\n= (15√3/14)^2 + 2*(15√3/14)*(t√3) + (t√3)^2\n\n= (225*3)/196 + (30*3)/14 t + 3t²\n\n= 675/196 + (90/14)t + 3t²\n\nNow, the next term: -7*(65/14 + t/4) = -7*65/14 -7*t/4 = -65/2 -7t/4\n\nThen, the last term: (7√3/3)*(15√3/14 + t√3) = 7√3/3 *15√3/14 + 7√3/3 * t√3\n\nFirst term: (7*15*3)/42 = (315)/42 = 7.5\n\nWait, compute:\n\n7√3/3 *15√3/14 = (7*15)*(√3*√3)/(3*14) = (105)*(3)/(42) = 315/42 = 15/2.\n\nSecond part: 7√3/3 * t√3 = 7*3*t/3 = 7t.\n\nSo the last term is 15/2 + 7t.\n\nNow, combining all terms:\n\n[4225/196 + 675/196] + [(65/28)t + (90/14)t] + [t²/16 + 3t²] + [-65/2 -7t/4] + [15/2 + 7t] = 0\n\nCompute each part:\n\nFirst, 4225/196 + 675/196 = 4900/196 = 25.\n\nNext, coefficients of t:\n\n65/28 t + 90/14 t = 65/28 t + 180/28 t = 245/28 t = 35/4 t.\n\nThen, coefficients of t²:\n\n1/16 t² + 3 t² = (1/16 + 48/16) t² = 49/16 t².\n\nConstants: -65/2 + 15/2 = (-65 +15)/2 = -50/2 = -25.\n\nLinear terms from the other parts: -7t/4 +7t = (-7t/4 +28t/4) =21t/4.\n\nSo putting all together:\n\n25 + 35/4 t + 49/16 t² -25 +21t/4 = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n25 -25 cancels. Then terms with t: 35/4 t +21/4 t =56/4 t=14t. And the t² term:49/16 t².\n\nSo equation:49/16 t² +14t =0\n\nMultiply both sides by16:\n\n49 t² + 224 t =0\n\nFactor t:\n\nt(49t +224)=0\n\nSolutions t=0, which corresponds to point A, and t= -224/49= -32/7.\n\nSo the parameter t= -32/7 gives point E.\n\nTherefore, coordinates of E are:\n\nx =65/14 + (-32/7)*(1/4) =65/14 -8/7=65/14 -16/14=49/14=3.5=7/2.\n\ny=15√3/14 + (-32/7)*√3=15√3/14 - (32√3)/7=15√3/14 -64√3/14= -49√3/14= -7√3/2.\n\nSo E is at (7/2, -7√3/2). Let me check if this makes sense. Since the circumcircle passes through B(0,0), C(7,0), A(65/14,15√3/14), and E(7/2, -7√3/2). Let me verify if E is on the circle.\n\nPlug into the equation x² + y² -7x + (7√3/3)y:\n\n(7/2)^2 + (-7√3/2)^2 -7*(7/2) + (7√3/3)*(-7√3/2)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(49/4) + (147/4) - 49/2 + (7√3/3)*(-7√3/2)\n\nSimplify:\n\n(49 +147)/4 -49/2 + (-49*3)/6\n\n196/4 -49/2 -147/6\n\n49 -24.5 -24.5\n\n49 -49 =0. Yes, so E is on the circle. Good.\n\nNow, circle γ has diameter DE. So DE is from D(35/8,0) to E(7/2, -7√3/2). Let's compute the midpoint of DE, which is the center of γ, and the radius.\n\nCoordinates of D: (35/8,0), E: (7/2, -7√3/2). Let me convert 7/2 to 28/8 for easier subtraction. So coordinates of E are (28/8, -7√3/2).\n\nMidpoint M: ((35/8 +28/8)/2, (0 + (-7√3/2))/2) = (63/8 /2, (-7√3/2)/2) = (63/16, -7√3/4).\n\nThe radius of γ is half of DE. Let's compute DE length.\n\nDistance between D and E:\n\nsqrt[(28/8 -35/8)^2 + (-7√3/2 -0)^2] = sqrt[(-7/8)^2 + (-7√3/2)^2] = sqrt[49/64 + 147/4] = sqrt[49/64 + 2352/64] = sqrt[2401/64] = 49/8.\n\nTherefore, the radius is 49/16.\n\nSo circle γ has center at (63/16, -7√3/4) and radius 49/16.\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection points of circles ω and γ, which are E and F. We need to find coordinates of F.\n\nWe already know E is one point. Let's find equations of both circles and solve for their intersection.\n\nEquation of ω: x² + y² -7x + (7√3/3)y =0.\n\nEquation of γ: (x -63/16)^2 + (y +7√3/4)^2 = (49/16)^2.\n\nLet me expand the equation of γ:\n\n(x -63/16)^2 + (y +7√3/4)^2 = 2401/256.\n\nExpand the squares:\n\nx² - (2*63/16)x + (63/16)^2 + y² + (2*7√3/4)y + (7√3/4)^2 =2401/256.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nx² - (126/16)x + (3969/256) + y² + (14√3/4)y + (147/16) =2401/256.\n\nSimplify:\n\nx² + y² - (126/16)x + (14√3/4)y + 3969/256 +147/16 -2401/256 =0.\n\nConvert 147/16 to 2352/256:\n\nSo total constants: 3969 +2352 -2401 = 3920. Wait, 3969 +2352 = 6321; 6321 -2401= 3920. So constants term is 3920/256.\n\nSimplify:\n\nx² + y² - (126/16)x + (14√3/4)y +3920/256=0.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 16: 3920/256 =245/16.\n\nSo equation of γ becomes:\n\nx² + y² - (126/16)x + (14√3/4)y +245/16 =0.\n\nNow, subtract the equation of ω from the equation of γ to eliminate x² + y²:\n\n[ - (126/16)x + (14√3/4)y +245/16 ] - [ -7x + (7√3/3)y ] =0 -0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-126/16 x +7x +14√3/4 y -7√3/3 y +245/16=0.\n\nConvert 7x to 112/16 x:\n\n-126/16 x +112/16 x = (-14/16)x = -7/8 x.\n\nFor y terms:\n\n14√3/4 y -7√3/3 y. Let's get a common denominator, say 12.\n\n14√3/4 =42√3/12, 7√3/3=28√3/12. So 42√3/12 -28√3/12=14√3/12=7√3/6.\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n-7/8 x +7√3/6 y +245/16=0.\n\nMultiply all terms by 48 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-7/8 x *48= -42x, 7√3/6 y *48=56√3 y, 245/16 *48=735.\n\nSo equation: -42x +56√3 y +735=0.\n\nDivide both sides by 7: -6x +8√3 y +105=0 => 6x -8√3 y =105.\n\nSo the equation of the radical axis of ω and γ is 6x -8√3 y =105.\n\nNow, since E and F lie on both circles, they lie on this radical axis. We already know E is (7/2, -7√3/2). Let's check if it satisfies 6x -8√3 y =105.\n\nCompute 6*(7/2) -8√3*(-7√3/2)=21 +8√3*(7√3/2)=21 + (56*3)/2=21 +84=105. Yes, correct.\n\nNow, to find the other point F, we can parametrize the line 6x -8√3 y =105 and find its intersection with either circle. But since we already know E is on this line and we need another intersection, maybe we can parametrize the line and find another point.\n\nAlternatively, since we know the radical axis is line 6x -8√3 y =105, and F is another intersection point, so line EF is the radical axis. So points E and F lie on this line. Therefore, to find F, we can parametrize the line and find another intersection with circle γ or ω.\n\nAlternatively, we can solve the system of equations given by ω and γ.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is parametric. Let's parametrize the line 6x -8√3 y =105. Let me solve for x in terms of y:\n\n6x =105 +8√3 y => x = (105 +8√3 y)/6.\n\nNow plug this into the equation of ω: x² + y² -7x + (7√3/3)y =0.\n\nSubstitute x:\n\n[(105 +8√3 y)/6]^2 + y² -7*(105 +8√3 y)/6 + (7√3/3)y=0.\n\nThis will result in a quadratic in y. Let's compute each term:\n\nFirst term: [(105 +8√3 y)/6]^2 = (105² + 2*105*8√3 y + (8√3 y)^2)/36\n\n= (11025 + 1680√3 y + 192 y²)/36\n\nSecond term: y²\n\nThird term: -7*(105 +8√3 y)/6 = (-735 -56√3 y)/6\n\nFourth term: (7√3/3)y\n\nCombine all terms:\n\n[11025 +1680√3 y +192 y²]/36 + y² + (-735 -56√3 y)/6 + (7√3/3)y =0\n\nMultiply all terms by 36 to eliminate denominators:\n\n11025 +1680√3 y +192 y² +36 y² -6*735 -6*56√3 y +84√3 y =0\n\nCompute each part:\n\n11025 -6*735 =11025 -4410=6615\n\n1680√3 y -6*56√3 y +84√3 y =1680√3 y -336√3 y +84√3 y=(1680 -336 +84)√3 y=1428√3 y\n\n192 y² +36 y²=228 y²\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n228 y² +1428√3 y +6615=0\n\nDivide all terms by 3 to simplify:\n\n76 y² +476√3 y +2205=0\n\nHmm, still not very nice. Maybe factor further? Let's see:\n\nCheck discriminant D = (476√3)^2 -4*76*2205\n\nCompute 476²: 476*476. Let me compute 400²=160000, 76²=5776, 2*400*76=60,800. So (400 +76)^2=400² +2*400*76 +76²=160000 +60800 +5776=226,576. So 476²=226,576. Then (476√3)^2=226,576*3=679,728.\n\nCompute 4*76*2205=4*76=304; 304*2205. Let's compute 304*2000=608,000, 304*205=62, 304*200=60,800 and 304*5=1,520. So 60,800 +1,520=62,320. Total 608,000 +62,320=670,320.\n\nSo discriminant D=679,728 -670,320=9,408.\n\n√D=√9408. Let's factor 9408:\n\nDivide by 16: 9408/16=588. 588=4*147=4*49*3=4*7²*3. So √9408=√(16*588)=4√588=4*14√3=56√3.\n\nThus, solutions y = [-476√3 ±56√3]/(2*76)= [(-476 ±56)√3]/152.\n\nCompute -476 +56= -420, -476 -56= -532.\n\nThus, y= (-420√3)/152 and y= (-532√3)/152.\n\nSimplify fractions:\n\nFor y1: -420/152= -105/38. So y1= (-105√3)/38.\n\nFor y2: -532/152= -133/38. So y2= (-133√3)/38.\n\nWe already know that E has y-coordinate -7√3/2= -133√3/38? Wait, let's check:\n\n-7√3/2 = - (7*19)√3/(2*19) = -133√3/38. Yes, so y2= -133√3/38 corresponds to point E. Therefore, the other solution y1= -105√3/38 is the y-coordinate of F.\n\nThen, x= (105 +8√3 y)/6. Plug y= -105√3/38:\n\nx= (105 +8√3*(-105√3/38))/6= (105 -8*105*3/38)/6= (105 -2520/38)/6.\n\nCompute 2520/38: Divide numerator and denominator by 2:1260/19≈66.315.\n\nSo 105 -1260/19= (1995 -1260)/19=735/19.\n\nThus x=735/19 divided by6=735/(19*6)=735/114=245/38.\n\nTherefore, coordinates of F are (245/38, -105√3/38).\n\nNow, we need to compute AF². Point A is at (65/14,15√3/14). Point F is at (245/38, -105√3/38). Let me compute the squared distance between these two points.\n\nCompute Δx=245/38 -65/14. Let's convert to common denominator 266 (which is 38*7):\n\n245/38=245*7/266=1715/266, 65/14=65*19/266=1235/266. So Δx=1715 -1235=480/266=240/133.\n\nΔy= -105√3/38 -15√3/14= -105√3/38 - (15√3*19)/266= -105√3/38 -285√3/266. Convert to common denominator 266:\n\n-105√3/38= -105√3*7/266= -735√3/266, so Δy= -735√3/266 -285√3/266= -1020√3/266= -510√3/133.\n\nNow, AF²= (Δx)^2 + (Δy)^2= (240/133)^2 + (-510√3/133)^2= [240² + (510² *3)] /133².\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n240²=57,600\n\n510²=260,100, so 260,100*3=780,300\n\nTotal numerator=57,600 +780,300=837,900.\n\nThus AF²=837,900 / (133²)=837,900 /17,689.\n\nSimplify this fraction. Let's see if 837,900 and17,689 have common factors.\n\nFirst, note that17,689 is 133². Let's check if 133 divides 837,900.\n\nDivide 837,900 by133:\n\n133*6300=837,900. Exactly. So 837,900=133*6300. Therefore, AF²=133*6300 /133²=6300/133.\n\nCheck if 6300 and133 are coprime. 133=7*19. Check if 7 divides6300: yes, 6300/7=900. 19 divides6300? 6300/19=331.578... no. So divide numerator and denominator by7:6300/7=900,133/7=19. So AF²=900/19. Therefore, m=900, n=19, which are coprime. So m +n=919.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{919}", "current_question": "Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\\omega$.
