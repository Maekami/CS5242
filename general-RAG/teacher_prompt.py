### General Reasoning Task

Solve the following question step by step, providing clear and logical reasoning throughout. Ensure your final answer is stated clearly at the end.

You are given:
- An **example question** that is similar to the current question.
- A **comparison** between the two questions to identify transferable reasoning strategies.
- Several **potentially helpful insights** based on the example.

Use the example and comparison to guide your reasoning.  
Only apply insights if they are clearly useful to the current question.

### General Reasoning Task

Solve the following question step by step using a clear and logical approach.

You are given:
- An **example question** that is similar to the current question.
- A **comparison** between the two questions to identify structural reasoning patterns.
- A **general step-by-step structure** derived from the example solution.

Use the structure as a flexible guide to reason through the current question.

Your task:
1. Read the question and the explanation carefully.
2. Extract only the essential reasoning steps needed to arrive at the final answer.
3. Remove irrelevant details, side notes, or speculative content.
4. Present a clean, concise, and logical reasoning path followed by a clear final answer.

You are provided with two reasoning questions:

---

**Example Question:**  
{example_question}

---

**Current Question:**  
{current_question}

---

Your task is to compare the two questions. Focus on the following:

- Similarities or differences in structure  
- Overlapping or distinct reasoning skills required  
- Types of logic or knowledge involved in each

**Do not attempt to solve the current question.**  
This step is only for analytical comparison.

Begin your response with: `**Comparison**`
